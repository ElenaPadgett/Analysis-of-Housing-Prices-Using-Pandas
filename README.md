# Learning-pandas-part-I
The goal of the following exercise is to learn the basic Pandas functionality and data visualization techniques. We'll load data from a CSV file, clean it up, answer some exploratory questions and plot a subset of our data.

Note: Theodore Petrou's book "Pandas Cookbook: Recipes for Scientific Computing, Time Series Analysis and Data Visualization using Python" was invaluable in learning all the different ways to wrangle the data.
